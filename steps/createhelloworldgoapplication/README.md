Create a directory for your `Hello, World!` workspace. In the created 
workspace initialise the Go application.

Write your `Hello, World!` application file then test your code.

Confirm that the application prints: `Hello, World!`.

The `go run` command is typically used as a shortcut for compiling and 
running a program that requires frequent changes.
